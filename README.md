## 🧠 Key Concepts

### 🌀 System Thinking
System Thinking helps in understanding complex relationships within a system by analyzing variables and feedback loops.  
In this project, it is applied to explore how solar cookers can be used as an alternative to traditional cooking methods.

### 💓 Empathy
Empathy plays a vital role in understanding the struggles of communities that rely on traditional methods.  
It emphasizes designing solutions **for people, with people**, ensuring cultural and social inclusiveness.
