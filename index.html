    <h1>Design Thinking For Social Innovation(DTSI)</h1>
    <h2>System Thinking</h2>
    <p>System Thinking helps manage the inherent complexity of digital intiatives by breaking down systems into
        manageable chunks and understanding the relationships between them. System thinking emphasizes the importance of
        feedback loops and an iterative approach. System thinking creates an imperative for collaboration across
        different team members.In a summary, System thinking is a vital tool for social innovators tackling complex
        challenges. it enables a more comprehensive understanding of interconnected elements, manages complexity, avoids
        unintended consequences, and drives the collaboration for genuin, lasting change.

    <h2>Activity 1 :</h2>
    <h3>Reflection on activity 1 :</h3>
    <p>
    <h3>1. IDENTIFIED VARIABLES WITHIN THE GIVEN SYSTEM ARE:</h3>
    Solar Irradince<br>
    Reflector geometry<br>
    ABSORBER PROPERTIES<br>
    INSULATION EFFECTIVENESS<br>
    COOKING LOAD<br>
    REFLECTOR MATERIAL<br>
    <h3>2. ANALYSIS OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THESE VARIABLES ARE:</h3>
    <h4>Solar Irradiance vs. Reflector Geometry:</h4>
    The amount of solar radiation captured depends heavily on the reflector size, shape and orientation<br>
    Larger reflectors can concentrate more sunlight onto the cooking vessel<br>
    The reflector curvature/geometry determines how well the sunlight is focused<br>
    Proper alignment with the sun's position is crucial for maximizing irradiance<br>
    <h4>Absorber Properties vs. Cooking Load:</h4>
    →The material and design of the absorber influences how well it can absorb and retain heat<br>
    →Dark, matt surfaces tend to absorb sunlight better than shiny surfaces<br>
    →Higher thermal mass absorbers can cook larger food loads by storing more heat<br>
    →The food type, quantity and starting temperature affect the energy needs<br>
    <h4>Insulation vs. Thermal Losses:</h4>
    →Effective insulation reduces conductive, convective and radiative heat losses<br>
    →This allows the cooker to reach and maintain higher interior temperatures<br>
    →However, too much insulation can inhibit sunlight transmission to the absorber<br>
    <h4>Cooking Load and Reflector Material:</h4>
    →For larger cooking loads or higher temperature requirements, a reflector material with high reflectivity is
    essential to concentrate as much solar energy as possible onto the cooking vessel or absorber.<br>

    →Reflectors made of materials with lower reflectivity may not be able to concentrate sufficient solar energy for
    larger cooking loads, leading to longer cooking times or incomplete cooking.<br>

    <h3>3.IMPLICATIONS OF THE PLACES CAUSAL LOOP:</h3>
    <h4>1.ENVIRONMENTAL IMPLICATIONS:</h4>
    → Reduced carbon emissions: Solar cookers do not rely on fossil fuels or other non-renewable energy sources, thereby
    reducing greenhouse gas emissions and contributing to a cleaner environment. <br>
    <h4>2.ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS: </h4>
    → Fuel savings: By harnessing free solar energy, solar cookers can significantly reduce or eliminate the need for
    purchasing cooking fuels, saving money for households and communities.
    <h4>3.SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS:</h4>
    → Improved health: The absence of smoke and harmful emissions from solar cookers can reduce the risk of respiratory
    diseases and improve overall health, particularly for women and children who are often exposed to indoor air
    pollution from traditional cooking methods.

    <h2>Empathy</h2>
    <p>Empathy in the context of slum communities using traditional cooking methods that lead to air pollution and
        health issues involves understanding and sharing the feelings, experience and putting ineself in the shoes of
        those affected, acknowledging thier struggles, and recognizing the impact of thier living conditions on thier
        health and well being. In short Empathy in the field of slum communities using traditionalcooking methods to
        cook food involves a deep understanding of the challenges faced by the slum people, a genuine concern for thier
        well-being, and a commitment to developing solutions that address thier needs while respecting thier cultural
        practices and living conditions.

    <h2>Pov Statement</h2>
    <p>“The People of vantamuri slum are very less accessible to the basic needs of life. They use Traditional methods
        of cooking food which causes a lot of health issues and also indoor and outdoor air pollution. Therefore by our
        idea we can reduce the pollution and also increase thee sustainability of life also this could be a awareness
        also to reduce pollution.”
